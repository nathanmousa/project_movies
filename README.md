# The Movie Database App

The Movie Database App is a ruby based program that compiles data of movies released and/or in production. You can search any movie to find more information regarding it. You can also look at upcoming, popular, recommended and top movies!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'project_movies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install project_movies

## Usage

The application itself has a built in user friendly GUI system that listens for user commands. Type 'exit' at anytime to exit the program and 'return' at anytime to return back to the main menu.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
